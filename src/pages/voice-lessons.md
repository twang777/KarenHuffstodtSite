Jones, has set the benchmark for her personal philosophy of ethics and ideal learning process in the voice studio.&nbsp;&nbsp;In David’s words, “Negativity creates inefficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;A negative studio environment destroys any hope of a healthy partnership between singer and teacher.”&nbsp;&nbsp;He, in turn, was influenced by his teacher, Allan Lindquest, who described his teaching philosophy as follows: “When teaching, we must treat the entire person, not just the voice!&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to understand how critically important it is to encourage singers psychologically.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great singing is inspired by the spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the human spirit is free, the resulting singing will be free as well”.&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Karen is totally committed to providing a “safe space”, where the student can build a “healthy” ego, self-reliance, and the independence, so necessary for forging and maintaining a professional career.</li>n</ol>nnnn<p><strong>Study Voice with Karen Huffstodt and elevate your artistry -&nbsp;</strong></p>nnnn<p>Whether your dream is to grace the world's most prestigious stages or to simply delve into the fascinating world of vocal technique, Karen Huffstodt's careful guidance offers a path to excellence.
